In today's data-driven business world, organizations recognize the value of leveraging data to make informed decisions. Human Resources (HR) is no exception, with HR professionals increasingly relying on data analysis to optimize workforce management, employee retention, and overall organizational performance.


we'll conduct a business analysis of an HR dataset to gain insights into employee attrition, engagement, and factors affecting these critical HR metrics.

Understanding the Data

The dataset used for this analysis includes various employee-related attributes such as age, gender, department, job role, marital status, and, most importantly, attrition status. Additionally, it contains performance indicators, such as job satisfaction and work-life balance, which provide valuable insights into the employees' overall engagement and well-being.

Attrition Analysis

Attrition Rate: One of the key metrics in HR is the attrition rate, which quantifies the percentage of employees who leave the organization during a specific time frame.

Factors Contributing to Attrition: To identify the factors contributing to attrition, we conducted a feature analysis. The top factors associated with attrition include job satisfaction, work-life balance, and department.

Job Satisfaction: Employees with lower job satisfaction are more likely to leave the company. It is crucial to focus on job satisfaction by addressing work-related concerns and enhancing the overall work experience.

Work-Life Balance: An imbalance between work and personal life is another leading cause of attrition. Organizations can implement policies and initiatives to improve work-life balance for employees.

Department: Certain departments have higher attrition rates than others. This data can guide HR and management to address specific departmental issues or offer retention incentives.
